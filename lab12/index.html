					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>I had problem that I had was the output not showing up on the webpage. I thought it was something in my html and or my js. I just wasn't sure where the problem was. Then I aksed my TA about it and he said check your console and fix any errors that may lead my code on not showing up. And it was taht I had two different names for the output and so I corrected that to make sure everything is linked properly.</p>

					<h2>Reflection:</h2>
					<p>Today's assignment was pretty straight foward. I completed it in my discussion class. I had a fewquestion about my output not showing and I asked my TA during class what was the problem and he said to check inspect and there we found that it wasn't working becasue m html and javascript had differnt things written down. So when I found out that. I changed everything and looked over everthing to make sure everthing was connected/ or spelled properly.TA and Corbin were very helpful on answering my consern about it not showing up. After that I everything was shwoung up properly and I finish the rest of my assignment and getting to add imgs.Honestly it was fun to create this lab casue I made a generator for getting sorted into characters in the Garfield Universe and I also added imgs of the characters. </p>
