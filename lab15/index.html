						<h2>Problems:</h2>
						<p>I was confused on what AJAX is. I had to watch the lecture video again to complete the assignment. When I stareted I was confused on the what I need to add but I just relized that I need a api.Then I found one; well I kind of copied the one that Wes found in the lecture video. When I was done with the javascript. I check the index.html to see any bugs in the code. I check the inspect to find that there were errors and the output yet again didn't show up. Its hard to look at every line to fine my errors so the Console was helpful. When I continued to have errors I check my code with chatgbt to fine out if I was going it correctly or not. It pointed out what was missing or wrong. It also helped with the missing div output at the end of my Results minor sections that also my div= output. </p>

						<h2>Reflection:</h2>
						<p>Well I think that I understood this Lab after I watch the lecture again and it was helpful to chek the console on inspect becasue it really hlepd out wtih finding out why my code was not working properly. I also used chatgbt becasue I was so sure that I was done and I wanted to commit to master. But when I clicked my button for Get Dinosaur Fact; it didn't work so it helped. IT told me that I had small issues like not having the same spelling or not ending the div and also for some reason my html had some issues for somereason and that was becasue DEFER was upercase and that doesn't work and I fixed it and recuploaed it to check again to make sure. I also added pictures of Dinosaur and changed the web design </p>
