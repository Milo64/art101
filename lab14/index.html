					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p> I think the Challenge was starting becasue I have so much I have to do it slipt my mind. I also was confused on staring the js code. So it took me awhile to figure it out and my partner helped.</p>

				<div id="Problems">
					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>The only problems that I ran in to was starting the js and also figuring out why my output wasnt showing. I check my js on the console and it said there were no errors on the js. So I check my html file and tried to looking at the output section to figure out why it wasn't showing and it was becasue the div on the output had a "c" instead of a "v". I changed that and it helped but not to show the actual data output. So i check my js again and I knew something here was missing so I copy & pasted my js code to chat gbt to figure out what was wrong and it told me that I was missing the #'s on the output's and so it uncomplete. I added the #'s and it fixed it. </p>

				<div id="Reflection">
					<h2>Reflection:</h2>
					<p>At first I was kinda confused so I had to rewatch the letture video and Ruby finished the assignment a bit before me so she helped with some of confusion. This assignment was about to create a loop that identified numbers 1 to 200, and sorting multiples of 3s, 5s, and 7s. The Js was okay just I had some trouble on it but I got it done. I asked Ruby how they did the columns on her CSS and I also looked it up on W2 schools. I also used the console log to check for errors and used chat gbt to find what I was missing. </p>
