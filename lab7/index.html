				<h2>Challenge:</h2>
				<p>The challenge that I had for this lab was having time to complete it becasue I was really busy with a welding project that I was really tired for becasue i was working over the weekend. But when I started the 1st task it was very easy to complete.</p>

				<h2>Problems:</h2>
				<p>A problem that I came aross was the doing task task 2 for sorting the strings. However, I just took a  break from this task and came back to it  a bit later. the problem was that it didn't show up on my html webpage and I asked my partner Ruby for help and they ask their gf for some guidess.And they told me that I had to recheck the console.log."nameSorted=", nameSorted. I relized that I didn't put return nameSorted.</p>

				<h2>Reflection:</h2>
				<p> After looking over my Webpage on inscpet. It was helpful to check anything that I missed when checking it myself. I also felt like I understood what I was kind of doing in the end. Kinda.</p>

					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>After completing Lab7. I understood the console.log part and using split and rearganing letters to make a new username. My partner was really helpful on rechecking my work. Ruby was really helpfull on reminding me on my part. But understood that sometime life can be crazy and no time. But in the end we both finished.</p>
