					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem that arose is trying to figure out the soultion to my challenge. I ask a game design major friend of mine for help. The console.log keeps on giving me problems and Im kind of tired becasue I did try to solve this probelm during class and asking around. My partner also was wondering the same thing about me too.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Well I tried to ask around and even that didn't work. When my parenter found out how to complete it. She showed me the method. However it did work when I tried to applied it to my console. So I discided to move on to the other task and complete the vs lab.js and the html & css. I will be honest I did skip that part of the task1 becasue it I just didn't understand so I might ask for help on wednesday. </p>
