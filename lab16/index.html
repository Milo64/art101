				<div id="Problems">
					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>The problem that I had was figuring our what was wrong with my code and and also setting up the API with in jquery. When I was having trouble I used the insccpet tool within the webpage and looked at the console to see my error I didn't see. I also used Chatgbt to find what was wrong with my code and it was helpful on telling what i did wrong what I could do to fix the proble.</p>

				<div id="Reflection">
					<h2>Reflection:</h2>
					<p>I made the last index.html file and started to make the files. I read the directions and started by completing the javascript. And that where I had some challenges with the API that was linked and how to formate the code and I also based it off the example that was given. While working on the js I would check the console for error and also asked chatgbt to check if I was on the right path on completing it. When I finished with that I checked my work agian on insepct and there was nothing wrong so I changed the CSS and added my comments to the index.html file. I also take my screenshot and put them in my Lab16 slide for me to turn in. </p>
