					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that did arrose was that for somereason when I linked my photo in the homepage it didn't seem to show up. when I check the webpage it only showed a img icon, but not the actual image. However I went back to rechecking my work and kept on rewritng the code to link my portrait and I finally managed it show up. But as that problem was solved, the image was very big that it was out of the pages view. I had to ask my partner to figure out where the css for the homepage. But after clicking all tabs i found it and added the chnanges to make it more visually appealing. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>At first when reviewing the assignment by myself it was confusing. But after doing the fisrt part in class it was somewhat easier to understand what I was doing. I did have a some question, which were answered with my partner. I also really liked the do the CSS part of it becasue I find it fun to decorate the webpage how I like it.</p>
