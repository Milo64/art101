				<h2>Problems:</h2>
				<p>The problems that arrose was the the console part but after figuering out how my parenter was doing it. I followed in example. And Understood I bit more. But when I moved on to the javascript part of the assighment I was kinda confused if we were doing something differnt or adding what we did the console to the js lab.</p>

				<h2>Reflection:</h2>
				<p> I don't really like the console becasaue when you make a mistake you can go back it either erase all or just continue Creating a new file for lab 8 was easy enough to complete but when we stared the actually work there where parts that were challenging but I somewhat. I ask classmate in class for some guideness about the javascript task and after what the told me i understood what the task help me figure out what I am supposed to do becasue I was a bit confused on the directions.But I hope that everything works and that I have completed it well. I had to ask chat gbt and wesbot for some help to see if the correctly.</p>
