					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>The problem that I had was doing the javascript jquery task of the assignment. I was having a hard time understanding the concept of it. I think my parenter Ruby also had a bit of trouble on getting my button to show on the webpage. I asked for help from my classmates that I sit next Ben and Corbin. Which they rock on seeing what small mistakes I have made that results on it not working properly.</p>

					<h2>Reflection:</h2>
					<p>Sorry that I had to turn this assignment a day late. I voted yesterday and It took awhile to fill out my ballot. I communicated to my parenter Ruby to let them know that I might not finish my hw by 11:59pm. Today being election day got me on my nerves and it beeen in my mind lately. I was kind of worried if I didn't fiish and also get to work on the lab9.  But when I came to class today I was very thankful to them and Wes beause he went over the lab9 and my friend let me understand it the end of the assignment. </p>
